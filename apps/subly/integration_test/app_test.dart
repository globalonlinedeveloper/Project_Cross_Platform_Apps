  /// but underneath an opaque bar. `scrollUntilVisible` finishes with
  /// `Scrollable.ensureVisible`, which scrolls the MINIMUM needed to bring the
  /// target inside the viewport RECT and knows nothing about what is painted on
  /// top of it — so it parked "Log out" at the viewport's bottom edge, under the
  /// bar. The tap at (800, 827) landed on the `Insights` tab, `signOut()` was
  /// never called, and the suite reported "Sign-out did not return to the login
  /// screen" — a sign-out message for a hit-testing problem.
  ///
  /// It began the night the settings list grew two rows (the open-source
  /// licences tile above and Delete account below): the extra scroll extent is
  /// what let `ensureVisible` park the button at the very bottom instead of
  /// stopping short at max-scroll. Nothing about signing out changed, which is
  /// why `test/sign_out_destination_test.dart` stayed green throughout — it
  /// mounts a 1200x4000 surface where nothing is ever occluded.

  //   in-app tap  →  DELETE {platform}/v1/account  (service-role precondition,
  //                  platform_db swept, RELAY to subly-api's own

  // told. "Deleted" from a server that deleted nothing is the one failure a user
  // can never detect for themselves — which is why the leg's proof is split
  // across the two and neither half is allowed to stand alone.
  //
  // ⚠️ THE ROW IS CREATED FIRST, DELIBERATELY. Erasing an account that owns no
  // rows is a purge that cannot fail: every count is already zero, and
  // verify_purged.mjs would report "nothing left" over a user who never had
  // anything. So this walk writes a subscription through the live Worker and
  // reads it back off Home BEFORE deleting — the same round-trip leg 2 uses —
  // so the "0 rows" the verifier finds afterwards is a state the run itself put
