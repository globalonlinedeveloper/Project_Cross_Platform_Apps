/// First-run setup screen. It loads subscriptions from the repository and
/// prepares the derived views, and the step labels now say exactly that.
///
/// 2026-07-27 - these labels previously read "Connecting to accounts",
/// "Reading bank statements", "Scanning inbox receipts", "Matching merchants",
/// "Detecting recurring charges". The app does NONE of those: there is no bank
/// or mail integration anywhere in the dependency graph, and this widget is a
/// timer over a fixed list. Telling a user their bank statements are being read
/// when they are not is a false claim about access to financial data, and a
/// store-submission and payment-processor risk on top of that. If real import is
/// ever built, these labels earn their way back one at a time, as each becomes
/// true. (They now live in `app_en.arb` as `scanStep1..5`; the honesty argument
/// above is about the COPY, and it travels with the key rather than being lost
/// when the literal moved.)
///
/// 🔴 THE BRIGHTNESS RULE FOR THIS FILE is the one stated in full on
/// [SubscriptionDetailScreen]: LIGHT keeps the literal token, byte-identical to
/// the pre-dark screen; only the dark arm derives from the scheme. Here that
/// touches the two ink/muted text colours and the progress track. The Scaffold
/// drops its `AppColors.bg` override and inherits
/// `theme.scaffoldBackgroundColor` — 0xFFF4F4F8 is a near-white, which on a
/// dark theme painted this entire first-run screen light. The results hero's
/// `AppColors.brandGradient` and the whites on it do NOT fork: a saturated
/// indigo→violet gradient is its own surface in either brightness, exactly as
/// the detail hero is. `AppColors.accent` on the ring and the meter is the same
/// case — a brand hue, legible on both, and swapping it for `scheme.primary`
/// would move the LIGHT build (see the theme-fork note in `app.dart`: the
/// seeded scheme's primary is no longer #6459F5 exactly).
